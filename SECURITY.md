# Security Policy

This project provides a reference implementation of Shamir Secret Sharing.

It does not store, transmit, or manage secrets beyond in-memory operations.
Security considerations are limited to correctness of the algorithm and
explicit failure semantics.

No vulnerability reporting process is defined at this stage.

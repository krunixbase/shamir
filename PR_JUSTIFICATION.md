# PR Justification

This repository prioritizes:
- Auditability over performance
- Determinism over convenience
- Explicit structure over implicit behavior

Design choices are documented to ensure that
the system can be reviewed, reasoned about,
and defended without relying on trust.

This is a reference implementation.
